						<p>Your final project is a usability study, presented during the final lab. Your presentation should run 5-8 minutes. You will be required to present the findings of your test in person.</p>
					
						<p>A slide presentation is acceptable, as is a longform document. Either way though, your report needs to present what you did, why you did it, what the results are, and what your recommendations are based on those results. You must also include all the data that backs up your conclusions (although you don't necessarily need to talk through every single data point, as that would be pretty boring).</p>

						<p>At 11:30 today we'll be helping to test the usability of the Humber Career Outlooks web app. Approach it as a participant, but while you're taking part, reflect on their methodology. We'll get to talk about what we thought about <em>their</em> testing in the lab. Would you have taken the same approach? Does this change how you'll interact with your test participants?</p>
