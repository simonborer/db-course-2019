						<p>I will be awarding up to 3 bonus points per person. These will be added to your final assignment mark. They will be awarded based on the questions you ask to your classmates about their assignments.</p>

						<p>Make sure they are <strong>questions</strong>. You won't get bonus points by being mean.</p>

						<p>Office culture is different from most other workplaces and it's definitely different from school.</p>
					
						<p>Offices have their own dialect, customs, style of dress, form of humour, and expectations around behaviour and communication.</p>

						<p>Every office is a little different. One question I like to ask when being interviewed is "What can you tell me about the culture here?</p>
					
						<p>This is a question about how to dress, how to talk to your co-workers, how supported you'll be in your work, and how aggressively you'll be expected to self-manage.</p>

						<p>Office culture in Canada is undergoing a generational shift.</p>
					
						<p>Older customs tend to be more formal in language and dress, more strict about job definitions and parameters (including work hours), and with more deference to authority.</p>
					
						<p>"Younger" offices tend to place more of an emphasis on 'likeability', blurring the lines between work and recreation, and have higher expectations about taking on responsibility.</p>
					
						<p>Expect to find an older office culture in larger institutions like universities, banks, and government.</p>
					
						<p>If the company you're working for has ever described itself as a 'startup', expect to have your work interrupted by grown men playing with children's toys.</p>

						<p>Particular attention needs to be paid to language. Some offices have a culture where, in some contexts, swearing or using <span role="img" aria-label="beaming face with smiling eyes">üòÅ</span> is the norm. What's important is that you communicate using the same norms as the rest of your team/office.</p>
					
						<p>Despite the generational differences, offices everywhere tend to be much gentler when communicating differences of opinion than, say, a restaurant or a construction site.</p>
					
						<p>However, there is an expectation that you will communicate your needs. Otherwise people will keep being polite with you - until they politely fire you.</p>

						<p>Modern office culture has certain expectations around 'respectfulness'. When addressing other people's ideas, <em>even when they're dumb ideas that make you angry</em>, you'll be expected to smile, say something positive, and then address your concerns by asking a gentle question.</p>
					
						<p>When you are asking questions today, your challenge is to ask questions that will get the answers you need, while still maintaining a good relationship with everyone in the room.</p>

						<p>But first - something I was reminded of.</p>
					
						<p>I was reading some writings by people with disabilities, and a point that kept coming up was this - no one is disabled.</p>
					
						<p>Which is to say, there is nothing about any one person that creates disability. Disability is created when society makes an assumption, and then hardcodes that into design.</p>
					
						<p>It's in the way we design our buildings and our cities, our school system, our language, et al.</p>
					
						<p>I think this is important, because you need to understand that when you make something, you are at risk of manufacturing disability.</p>

						<p>Accessibility is both a philosophy and a legal requirement.</p>

						<p><strong>Law</strong>: The Access for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, in accordance with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, mandates a level of WCAG compliance.</p>

						<p>WCAG compliance mandates semantics, content, proper source order, text alternatives to visual information, accomodations for colour-blindness and low visual acuity, keyboard-only functionality, and the use of the WAI-ARIA specification.</p>

						<p><strong>Semantics</strong> in HTML refers to using native elements and attributes for their defined purpose.</p>
					
						<p>A correct <strong>source order</strong> means that the visual flow of the document matches the source code.</p>
					
						<p><strong>Text alternatives</strong> are provided when information is presented visually - this includes images, graphs, charts and tables, but also cases where elements have implicit functions based on the visual design, i.e. buttons within a form.</p>

						<p>We can provide alternatives to this visual information with <code>alt</code> tags for graphic content, <code>scope</code> and <code>caption</code> for tables, and <code>label</code>s or screen reader-specific content for inputs, buttons and links.</p>
					
						<p>We must also keep in mind that our elements are often used as navigational landmarks for people using non-visual clients, including headers for document structure.</p>

						<p>Because not all visually impairments require the use of a screenreader, we provide <strong>alternatives to colour cues</strong> for people with colour-blindness (i.e. focus outline, proper labelling), and for people with reduced visual abilities we check our <strong>colour contrast ratios</strong> and test our websites for up to <strong>200% zoom</strong>.</p>

						<p>For people with motor-impairment issues, we ensure that we do not disable the native functionality of our proper semantic HTML, and where native functionality is not available, we create <strong>keyboard events</strong> to supplement our click events.</p>
					
						<p>We also maintain our tab order by having our source order properly represented.</p>
					
						<p>On those rare occasions where our visual order and source order are in conflict, we can control focus with Javascript.</p>
					
						<p>Where we want to make an element focusable that does not have native focusability, we can use the <code>tabindex='0'</code> attribute value.</p>

						<p>In order to enforce accessibility compliance and best practices, we need to help our team mates understand these techniques. We can encourage our team to use <strong>manual testing tools</strong> like the WAVE browser plugin, incorporate <strong>linting</strong> into our build process and <strong>auditing</strong> into our deployment or site monitoring</p>
					
						<p>Additionally, because some accessibility techniques, especially ARIA, are context-dependent, automated enforcement can be a challenge. Manual <strong>code review</strong> is an essential part of making our whole team stronger and our product better.</p>

						<p>Once we begin to test our design and development, we use tests to produce both <strong>qualitative</strong> and <strong>quantitative</strong> data.</p>
					
						<p>Depending on what kind of data we are generating, there are industry standard sample sizes for each test. Qualitative testing, being more exploratory, tends to have smaller sample sizes.</p>

						<p>To facilitate discussion and decision-making, we can apply quantitative metrics to qualitative data. One example of this is the PURE rubric, for assigning values to the ease with which a task is accomplished.</p>
					
						<p>This should not overshadow the fact that the most valuable information gained in qualitative testing is usually individual, and best reported in the words of the participant or observer.</p>

						<p>Before we test, we plan. After we test, we report.</p>
					
						<p>A good test plan can be a <strong>proposal</strong> (when seeking approval) that provides a clear picture of the time and costs, and makes a case for the efficacy of data that is being generated.</p>
					
						<p>A good test plan might also be, assuming that approvals and funding are secured, <strong>simple documentation</strong> for your team, in order to keep sight of the scope, definitions, and goals.</p>

						<p>When performing a test, we try to capture data that is clean and unbiased. We can do this by using careful language, so as not to influence our test participants.</p>
					
						<p>We also do this by having strong sample sizes, and reducing the number of variables between our tests, i.e. maintaining a consistent hardware and software environment.</p>

						<p>Once our test data is collected, we format it, and discuss it within our team.</p>
					
						<p>Collaborating on our recommendations reduces individual bias.</p>
					
						<p>We then weigh our recommendations based on issue severity and the resources required to implement.</p>
					
						<p>Whenever possible, we try to provide more than one option for each issue, so the client can decide what is best for them - without putting them in the position of rejecting our work.</p>

						<p>A report should be easy to read and understand. Choosing the right format for presenting data is essential to interpreting it.</p>
					
						<p>If you have been rigourous in your testing, then your report can be presented in very plain language.</p>
					
						<p>Reporting these results is often done in-person. It's important that you understand everything that went into the test and the recommendations, and anticipate questions that the client may raise.</p>
