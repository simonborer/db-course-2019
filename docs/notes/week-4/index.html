        	<h3>Compile</h3>
        	
				
					
						<p>So, you have your data. The first step is to compile it so you know what you're working with.</p>
					
						<p>Most of you have chosen to collect multiple datasets in parallel - you'll want to compile that separately (even though it was collected during the same test).</p>
					
						<p>If you do this step diligently, you'll save time in the long run. Make it easy to read and understand.</p>

        	<h3>Analyze</h3>
        	
				
					
						<p>If you're doing this step with the help of some fellow experts (recommended), it's time to look at what your data actually tells you.</p>
					
						<p>If you have a good sample size, and tight controls, it will be pretty apparent.</p>
					
						<p>On the other hand, if your sample size is too small, or your variables too... variable, it will be hard to draw conclusions with confidence.</p>

						<p>Listen, you're not doing hard science. But understand that people will ask you hard questions about why you're coming to your conclusions. And if your conclusions are wrong, you'll have to answer for that.</p>
					
						<p>People aren't looking to you for maybes - maybe it was the browser, maybe it was the device, maybe that user was really tired - they want answers. Specific answers. 'If you change the order of your menu items, conversions will go up 10-12%' answers. And they want those answers to turn out to be right.</p>
