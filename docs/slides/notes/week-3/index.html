      <p>Okay, so <code>12.9107344632768361581920903954802259887</code> is correct, but probably more information than we need to display.

      <p>What if we want to run aggregate functions on more than one thing? The <code>GROUP BY</code> clause lets us run a function on each distinct value in the column that we group by.</p>

      <p>Other than that, subqueries rarely have a use-case outside of deep complexity, and will usually introduce more complexity than they resolve.</p>
      <p>We can learn more about them later in the year, if we have time. At that point you'll be comfortable with <code>JOIN</code>s, clauses and the order of operations, and you'll be better able to judge when a subquery might be justified.

      <p>This week, I've made an effort to write the lab questions as just that - questions that need answers. Pay special attention to your formatting. Use aliases where aliases help readability. Show the columns that someone would need in order to make sense of the return table.</p>

      <h3>Lab Questions:</h3>
      <ol class="lab-questions">
        <li>Write a statement to return the average time, rounded off to two decimal places, of vehicle thefts for each month. Only include occurrences between 2014 and 2017. Order the results from the latest time of day to the earliest.</li>
        <li>Write a statement that shows a list of premises types with more than 500 total thefts.</li>
        <li>Write a statement that returns the oldest incident from this dataset.</li>
        <li>Write a statement that returns the top 10 neighbourhoods that had the most reported thefts in 2017.</li>
        <li>Write a statement that returns the top 5 neighbourhoods in terms of thefts (in any year), and a column that shows how many incidents they had above the average neighbourhood. <em>This may be a good case for a subquery.</em></li>
        <li>Write a statement to insert your own character in the <code>characters_copy</code> table, with no null values. Give yourself the most hitpoints of any character (but only by one).</li>
        <li>Wait, that looks suspicious. Write a statement to update your character so that you've got the fourth highest hitpoints.</li>
        <li>Get a list of all the subclasses that are schools and are associated with a character whose constitution stat is an even number.</li>
        <li>Write a statement that returns the earliest invoice for each line item description, provided that the line item description begins with a letter in the first half of the alphabet, and the vendor's last name ends with a letter in the second half of the alphabet. At which point, I'll admit, we're getting a little silly.</li>
