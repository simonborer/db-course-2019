      <h2>For your midterm assignment, write a usability test plan.</h2>

      <p>Your plan should be written as though you are seeking approval/buy-in. As such, you should be providing rationale for all of your choices. For example, it is not enough to simply list your metrics; you must explain how those metrics will be used to meet your objective. Simply put, you must explain the <strong>WHY</strong> for all your choices.</p>

      <h3>Your test plan must address the following:</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Objective</li>
        <li>Scope</li>
        <li>Participants</li>
        <li>Methods</li>
        <li>Metrics</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Your plan <em>may</em> include the following sections:</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Executive summary</li>
        <li>Schedule and location</li>
        <li>Equipment</li>
        <li>Scenarios</li>
        <li>Roles</li>
      </ul>

      <p>For a detailed explanation of both of the above lists, see the course notes.</p>

      <h3>Evaluation criteria</h3>

      <p>This is not an instance where the longest submission will get the highest grade. When seeking buy-in, it is important that your plan be clear and concise. As above, this test plan is not written strictly as documentation, but is meant to be persuasive. Write it as a professional usability document, but one that is accessible to non-technical readers.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, write the test plan that is best for the test. Include information that is relevant to the <strong>type</strong> and <strong>scope</strong> of the test that you have chosen.</p>

      <p>Feel free to work from the usability.gov template, or to base your work on one of the examples. Take care, though, that this fits with the test you are planning.</p>
