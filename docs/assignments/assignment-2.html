      <p>Use SQL Developer to write SELECT statements to produce the required results.</p>
      <p>Some of the questions are multi-part ("Then...", "Next...", etc.) Refer to each of the parts as a), b) etc.</p>
      <p>Each command (or adjustment of the previous command) should be their own screen captures. Use screen captures of your SQL Developer session to show the command and its output.</p>
      <div class="callout warning">Some statements will produce a lot of rows. It's not required that you screencap every single row, but you must show enough to demonstrate that the statement produces the intended results.</div>
      <p>Your submitted assignment should be a PDF that includes all your screen caps.</p>
      <p>Use comments to write your name, the assignment number, and the question number <em>in the SQL Developer input</em> above your query.</p>
      <p>Submit the assignment through Blackboard.</p>
      <div class="callout alert">These queries are run against the tables we created in the first class. If you did not run the .sql in the first class, <a href="/docs/assets/documents/create_ap_tables.sql">it is still available</a>.</div>
