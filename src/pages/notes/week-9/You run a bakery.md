You run a bakery.

Your bakery has three locations in the west end of Toronto.

Your bakery has 2 types of employee - bakers and cashiers.

Your bakery initially produces 6 types of pasteries, and 4 types of bread. You also serve coffee.


You may need to: 
   - create a schedule for your employees
   		- no employee can work more than 44 hours/week
   		- no employee can work less than 25 hours/week
   		- shifts are a minimum of 4 hours, and a maximum of 8
   		- employees can be scheduled to work at different locations
   		- cashiers cannot bake, and bakers cannot do cashier duties
   - create a menu (a price list)
   		- each week the price of a different item is reduced by 20%
   		- each week the price of two items are reduced by 10%
   - evaluate the cost of items including materials and labour, and try to find efficiencies; each type of food or beverage should list the total cost of ingredients; the food should list the baking time, and the bakers' prep time, along with the required baking temperature and the required oven space
   - track transactions at the bakery


How do you design your database tables?
How do you write a stored procedure to add a new type of bread?
How do you write a function to return the menu?
How do you validate the data so that you can create a new schedule?
Can you create a baking schedule (keeping in mind that there is limited oven space, varied by location, and that foods with the same baking temperature can share an oven)?
Can you calculate the cost per unit of different foods (factoring in the labour involved)?
What other metrics could you track/calculate to help the business?
