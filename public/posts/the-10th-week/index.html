Since foods can be eaten by different animals, and most animals can each eat different types of food, what is the relationship between these tables called?</li><li>To make life easier, we'd want to have a table that can go between the food table and the animal table. This table could be called "diet", as it represents all the types of food that can be eaten by a given animal, and all the animals who might eat a given food. What do we call this <em>kind</em> of table?</li><li>What kind of relationship does the "diet" table have with the animals table?</li><li>Let's say there is a table for the different parking lots. Each parking lot has a single collection booth for collecting parking fees. There is a separate table for the collection booths. What kind of relationship is there between these tables (parking lots & collection booths)? Can anything be done to make the database better organized?</li><li>There is a table of zookeepers. Zookeepers work on a schedule. The schedule table references the zookeeper's id. What constraint is the zookeeper's id in the schedule table?</li><li>In the schedule table, a zookeeper cannot work more than 44 hours in a given week. How could this constraint be enforced automatically when inserting zookeeper shifts in the database?</li><li>Zookeepers want to see their schedule, but cannot update the schedule on their own. Since these zookeepers are all very tech savvy, how can we give them database access that does not allow them to do things they're not allowed to do?</li><li>Zookeepers are smart, but snoopy. Given that they have database access, how could we allow them to see the schedules of other zookeepers who work within the same habitat (which they need to know), but restrict them from seeing the schedules of zookeepers working in other habitats (which they don't need to know)?</li><li>There is a database record of individual animals, which is separate from the table of animal types (brown bears, koalas, giraffes, etc.). The zoo has lost the ability to provide habitat for kangaroos, and will permanently transfer all kangaroos to another zoo. How can we remove the animal type "kangaroo" and automatically remove all individual kangaroos from the database?</li><li>It is important to keep the animals fed. All animals must have at least 20 meals in reserve. If the inventory drops below 20 meals, it must be listed as "order immediately" in the "food order" table. How could we do this automatically?</li><li>Back in the parking lot, zoo visitors may buy a parking pass. Parking costs $10, but if you visit five times, you can park for free for the rest of the month. How would you automatically calculate the cost of parking for a visitor with a pass?</li></ol></div></div></section></div></div></div></article></main><script src=https://www.dbcourse2019.com/js/prism.js></script><script src=https://www.dbcourse2019.com/js/codemirror.js></script><script src=https://www.dbcourse2019.com/js/xml.js></script><script src=https://www.dbcourse2019.com/js/css.js></script><script src=https://www.dbcourse2019.com/js/javascript.js></script><script src=https://www.dbcourse2019.com/js/htmlmixed.js></script><script src=https://www.dbcourse2019.com/js/sql.js></script><script type=text/javascript>function qsa(sel){return Array.apply(null,document.querySelectorAll(sel));}
