We're used to joining things on a key, like an id, that is unique for at least one of the tables, but in this case we're joining on the city. So this query produces a list of all rows from one table that have the same city as the rows in the other table (<code>v1.vendor_city = v2.vendor_city</code>).</p></div></div></section><section><div class=grid-x><div class="cell large-10 large-offset-1"><p>Then, on top of that, we say we're only going to join the rows <em>if</em> the id in the first table <em>doesn't</em> match the id in the second table.
