      <p>The material covered in the final will be quite similar to the material you covered while working on the Library database.</p>

      <p>Here's some exercises you can do as a way of working through your notes to review for the final.</p>
      <p>Imagine you are working on the database for a zoo.</p>
      <img src="/images/zoo.jpg" alt="Giraffes and zebras.">
      <ol>
        <li>There is a table of animals, and table of animal foods. Since foods can be eaten by different animals, and most animals can each eat different types of food, what is the relationship between these tables called?</li>
        <li>To make life easier, we'd want to have a table that can go between the food table and the animal table. This table could be called "diet", as it represents all the types of food that can be eaten by a given animal, and all the animals who might eat a given food. What do we call this <em>kind</em> of table?</li>
        <li>What kind of relationship does the "diet" table have with the animals table?</li>
        <li>Let's say there is a table for the different parking lots. Each parking lot has a single collection booth for collecting parking fees. There is a separate table for the collection booths. What kind of relationship is there between these tables? Can anything be done to make the database better organized?</li>
        <li>There is a table of zookeepers. </li>
      </ol>
