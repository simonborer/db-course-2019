      <div class="callout warning">Tip: create a trigger so that after you delete an object (like an invoice or employee), appropriate references to that object get deleted. This protects your database against 'orphan data'.</div>

      <p>Library patrons have library cards. They are used when patrons borrow books. Books can be borrowed for up to three weeks.</p>
      <p>Patrons are charged late fees when they do not return their books on time, unless the patrons 'renews' the book. They can renew the book for one week, up to two times. Late fees are 10 cents per business day.</p>
