      <p>This one gave a few people trouble. Maybe it was how the question was worded, but the answer was meant to be not just the date of hiring, but the difference between <code>hiredate</code> and the current date. I gave out a lot of half marks for this.</p>

      <p>Okay, a lot of you were <em>all over the place</em> with your joins. I suggest reviewing which joins do what, because problems like this take a little bit of thinking.</p>
      <p>In this case, an inner join selects all classes with an assigned teacher because if there's no teacher, the join omits the class row.</p>

        <li>Create a stored procedure or function for anything from the previous weeks, the syntax of which you find difficult to remember.</li>
        <li>Create 2 tables, one called my_books, one called my_movies. In each, create a primary key, a column called 'title', a column called 'genre', and a column called 'rank'. Then create a stored procedure that can insert a row into either of those tables, with the values passed as parameters. Insert at least 3 each of your favourite books and movies into the tables using your procedure.</li>
        <li>Create a stored function that can return the title based on your ranking.</li>
